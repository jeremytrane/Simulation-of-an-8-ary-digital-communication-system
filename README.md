# **8-ary Digital Communication System Simulation**

Simulate an 8-ary digital communication system with QAM modulation. This project demonstrates the differences between theoretical and simulated SER, and also visualizes the simulated BER.

## 🌟 **Features**

- **8-ary QAM Constellation**: Uses an optimized constellation for data representation.
- **Error Comparisons**: Compares the theoretical SER against the simulated SER.
- **Visualization**: Provides plots to visualize the BER & SER against different SNR values.

## 📝 **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system to execute the script.

## 🚀 **Usage**

1. In MATLAB, execute the provided script.
2. Visualize the results through the generated plots.

## 📊 **Output**

Upon execution, you'll observe:

- A plot contrasting the theoretical and simulated SER.
- A visualization of the simulated BER.
